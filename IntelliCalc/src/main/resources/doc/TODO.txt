- Re-Design evaluator:
  The evaluator could use some refactoring.

- IntelliJ integration (toolwindow):
  Switching between simple and scientific modes does not go smoothly when the calculator is docked.
  Resizing can not be performed easily.
  An option might be to register/deregister a toolwindow for each mode on the fly. Might be problematic
  because it would be possible for the calculator to move its anchor.

- Configuration options:
  * Grouping
  * Precision
  * Colors
  * Fonts
