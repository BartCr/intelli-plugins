    <description><![CDATA[
        A small calculator integrated in IntelliJ.
        <p>
        The calculator has three modes:
        <dl>
            <dt>Simple
            <dd>A simple calculator with just the basic functions
            <dt>Scientific
            <dd>A scientific calculator with more advanced functions
            <dt>Expression
            <dd>Allows to enter an expression containing variables.
        </dl>
        <p>
        Use it as a normal simple calculator (with advanced functions) or evaluate expressions directly from your
        editor. To evaluate an expression in the editor, simply select the expression and select Evaluate in the
        editor popup menu or simply press alt F8. Remember that when debugging a program, the alt F8 function will be
        bound to the "Evaluate Expression" action of the IntelliJ IDEA.
        <p>
        The expression mode knows math functions (add, subtract, sin, cos, acotan, ...), logical operators (||, !=, ...)
        and some special functions:
        <dl>
            <dt>set()
            <dd>will set a variable so it can be used in a calculation. Ex. set(x=2)[enter]2*x[enter]returns 4
            <dt>clear()
            <dd>Clears a stored variable. Ex. clear(x) will clear the variable x. Note that any calculation using x
                will fail until a new x has been set.
        </dl>
        Awaiting suggestions to improve the calculator.
